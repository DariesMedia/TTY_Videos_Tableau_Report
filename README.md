## TOP 995 TRENDING YOUTUBE VIDEOS ANALYSIS

Cleaning and analysing top trending YouTube videos data as well as creating an interactive report with Tableau

## Introduction

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). 

The dataset used for this analysis is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos which was collected using the YouTube API.


## Tasks to Perform

1. Data Cleaning: deleting redundant columns, renaming the columns, dropping duplicates, cleaning individual columns, removing/renaming blank values from the dataset and check for some more transformations

2. Data Visualization 

## Report Requirement

While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see the overall 10 trending YouTube videos and their highest monthly income. However, during the report design I was also interested in doing a root-cause analysis to identify factors influencing the popularity of these videos over time.
